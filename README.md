CurrencyConv is a simple Application for Linux Desktop that converts currencies in seconds. All you need to do is select the currency that you are converting to and put the amount using the keyboard. That's it. This is a drop-dead easy application for this basic function of currency conversion.

**Main features:**

- Latest exchange rates for active APIs
- Historical Currency rates available for upto year 1999
- Graphical representation of Currency Rates in selected date range
- Light and Dark theme 
- Simple UI/UX
- Offline usage once you load currency data once a day

More features and enhancements soon in near future.

**NOTE**: This app is written packaged and published in 1 day, I developed this as part of initiative taken by (imakefoss twitter handle). I was given opportunity by awesome people at imakefoss.org to talk in topic "Broadening the Linux GUI application ecosystem" this week.
